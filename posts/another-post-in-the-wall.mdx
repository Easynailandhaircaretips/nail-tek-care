What are Polygel Nails?
---

Polygel nail technique is an approach that can take your manicure to the next level. It is similar to gel and acrylics, taking the good qualities of both but without the negatives. Polygel has a putty consistency and is applied to the nails and then smoothed with a flat brush. It is incredibly versatile and can be used as an overlay to natural nails or sculpted in the same way as acrylics. It requires no mixing or monomers and does not contain harsh chemicals. You are getting strong, flexible, and light nails that do not have a strong odor and will not harm your natural nails. They can be cured under an LED lamp or UV light, and are often clear, pink, or white, but can be mixed with gel or regular polish if you want to experiment with colors.

Polygel vs. Gel
At first glance, you may see very little difference between Polygel and gel nails, but there are some important distinctions. Gel nails are not an extension of your natural nails but instead a type of polish that usually lasts longer than the regular nail polish. Polygel on the other hand is stronger than hard gel and can be applied as a natural nail overlay, or as an enhancement. Both gel and Polygel are cured under UV light, but Polygels can also be cured using an LED lamp. They tend to be lighter and more flexible and do not have a strong smell. Gel nails are thinner than Polygel and are therefore more prone to breakage.

There are definite pros to acrylic nails, especially the length and versatility of nail shapes and nail art. That said, Polygel offers an attractive alternative. One of the significant benefits of Polygel over acrylics is that they tend to be more flexible, lighter, and stronger. They are less likely to break and also look and feel natural. They do not have an odor; some people think that the monomer dust applied to acrylics has a very strong smell. Another benefit to Polygel is that it is easier to apply and does not require any mixing, the way that acrylics do. Acrylics are created using a mixture of powder monomer and acrylic liquid. Acrylic nails are an extension on your natural nail, whereas Polygel can be an extension, or applied onto your natural nails as an overlay.

Apply the Polygel
When applying the Polygel, your nail technician will place a pea-sized amount onto the nail using a small metal tool. It is helpful to use a two-sided tool with a spatula and a brush. Using a brush end, it is dipped into a slip solution, making it easier to shape and preventing the gel from sticking to the tool. The Polygel will be sculpted into your chosen shape and length. If you want extensions, then you will use this step to place the cone over your nail.

Cure the Nails 
Polygel nails need to be cured, and this can be done using an LED light or a UV lamp. Depending on the brand of Polygel you use, the time it takes to cure will differ slightly, but it should be around 30 seconds under an LED and 2 minutes using a UV lamp. Polygel will not harden unless it is cured. This step is repeated later.

File
Filing is an essential step when applying Polygel, and because it is soft, you do not need an e-file to shape it. You can use a hand file to smooth out any uneven areas and sculpt your desired shape.

Apply Finish

Apply Lotion or Oil
The aftercare of a manicure is incredibly important to ensure that your hands and cuticles are moisturized. If you go to a salon, the nail technician will likely complete your manicure by adding oil to the base of your cuticles and rubbing a good quality lotion on your hands. The same should apply if you are attempting to create Polygel nails in the comfort of your own home. This will keep your skin moist but can also help prevent cracking and provide protection. Squeeze cream onto your palm and massage it through, paying close attention to your fingertips.
